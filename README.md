# Movie-Recommender

## Introduction

This README/report provides an overview of a movie recommendation app project. The purpose of this project is to develop a movie recommendation app that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The app utilizes content-based filtering techniques to make movie recommendations.

## Project Overview

The movie recommendation app is designed to help users discover new movies that align with their interests and preferences. It does this by analyzing the content and features of movies in a dataset and recommending movies that are similar in terms of their content.

## Setup Instructions

Before running the movie recommendation app, you need to set up the environment and install the required packages. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

4. Additionally, you need to install the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for text processing:

   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

5. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the project repository to execute the movie recommendation app.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes two datasets:
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains information about movies, including their titles, genres, keywords, and overviews.
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Contains details about the cast and crew of the movies.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Loading**: The datasets are loaded using the Pandas library.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Data cleaning involves handling missing values and processing text data to extract relevant information.

3. **Feature Engineering**: A new column called 'tags' is created by combining relevant information from different columns (genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview).

## Text Vectorization

The 'tags' column is converted into numerical vectors using the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn. This step is essential for performing similarity calculations.

## Similarity Calculation

Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between movies based on their tags. This allows the app to identify movies that are similar in terms of their content.

## Movie Recommendation

A recommendation function is implemented to provide movie recommendations. Users can input a movie title, and the app will suggest similar movies based on content-based filtering techniques.

## Conclusion

The movie recommendation app is an excellent tool for movie enthusiasts looking to discover new films aligned with their tastes. By analyzing the content and features of movies, the app provides personalized recommendations. The setup instructions provided in this README/report will guide you through the process of setting up and running the app on your local machine.

Feel free to explore the project, experiment with different movie titles, and discover new movies that match your preferences. Enjoy using the movie recommendation app!
